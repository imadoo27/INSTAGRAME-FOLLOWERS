# Instagram Followers Script (Fake Instagram Account)

This project provides a script that allows you to gain followers on Instagram using a fake Instagram account. It simulates the process of following users, mimicking natural behaviors to boost engagement.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Termux**: A powerful terminal emulator for Android.
- **p7zip**: A tool for handling `.7z` archives in Termux.

## Installation

### 1. Install Termux

Download and install **Termux** from the Google Play Store or F-Droid if you haven't already.

### 2. Install Required Packages

After installing Termux, open the app and run the following command to install **p7zip**, which is required to extract `.7z` files:

```bash
pkg install p7zip
```

This will install the necessary package for handling `.7z` archives.

### 3. Extract the Script Archive

Once you have installed the required tools, navigate to the directory where your `.7z` archive (e.g., `dist.7z`) is located. Use the following command to extract the contents of the archive:

```bash
7z x insta-followers.7z
```

This will extract all files from the `dist.7z` archive, making the script and all necessary components available for use.

## Usage

Once you've extracted the files, navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd insta-followers
```

Make sure all dependencies for the script are installed, including any necessary Python libraries or other tools. If the script is written in Python, for example, you might need to install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Script

Now, you can start the script to gain followers on Instagram. Depending on the language used for the script (e.g., Python, JavaScript), you'll run it like this:

For a Python script:

```bash
python followes-10.py
```

### Important Notes

- **Fake Accounts**: This script uses a fake Instagram account to simulate interactions, so be mindful of Instagram's terms of service. It is important to respect social media platforms' rules to avoid getting banned or penalized.
  
- **Performance**: The number of followers added depends on the rate at which the script interacts with other accounts. Be careful not to set the script to follow too many accounts in a short period to avoid suspicion or account suspension.
